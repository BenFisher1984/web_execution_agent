# 📄 Advanced Execution Scaling Features (Future Roadmap)

## Purpose
Capture professional-grade execution engine improvements to support higher user volumes, faster markets, and advanced risk models. These are enhancements to be prioritized after dynamic contingent orders are delivered and tested.

---

## 🟦 1️⃣ Batch Tick Processing with Prioritization

- Replace per-tick processing with micro-batches (e.g., 100–200 ms windows)
- Rank trades using a priority queue:
  - Example priority metric: distance to stop-loss
  - Process high-risk trades first
- Benefits:
  - Reduced event loop overhead
  - Faster critical exit execution under tick storms
  - Scalable to 100s of symbols
- Effort: ~4–5 engineering days
- Files:
  - `tick_handler.py`
  - `trade_manager.py` (helper function for distance-to-stop)

---

## 🟦 2️⃣ TTL-Based Smart Caching

- Add time-to-live expiration to:
  - `contract_cache`
  - `volatility_cache`
- Periodically refresh stale entries in the background
- Avoids outdated data issues (e.g., corporate actions, symbol changes)
- Benefits:
  - Resilience to stale market definitions
  - Smoother trade execution
- Effort: ~2 days
- Files:
  - `ib_client.py`
  - optional background worker

---

## 🟦 3️⃣ Shadow Orders (Preemptive What-If Validation)

- Simulate contingent exit orders ahead of time using IB’s `whatIf`
- Store margin requirements and feasibility snapshot
- When the actual trigger hits, submit with high confidence of acceptance
- Benefits:
  - Reduced risk of IB rejecting live orders
  - Faster contingency fills
- Effort: ~2–3 days
- Files:
  - `order_executor.py`
  - `trade_manager.py`

---

## 🟦 4️⃣ Portfolio Risk Rebalancer

- Evaluate portfolio-wide risk exposure every 1–5 minutes
- Block or throttle new entries if user exceeds maximum risk thresholds
- Benefits:
  - Prevents user from over-leveraging with many trades
  - Complies with professional risk policy
- Effort: ~2–3 days
- Files:
  - `trade_manager.py`
  - optional background coroutine

---

## 🟦 5️⃣ Dynamic Volatility Refresh

- Re-calculate ADR / ATR on a rolling window intra-session
- Better adapt to news spikes or volatility regime changes
- Benefits:
  - More realistic stops
  - Improved risk metrics
- Effort: ~1–2 days
- Files:
  - `volatility.py`
  - `trade_manager.py`

---

## 🟦 6️⃣ Order Throttling and Flood Control

- Add a configurable throttle:
  - e.g., no more than X orders per second globally
- Benefits:
  - Protects against IBKR rate limits (typically ~50 orders/sec)
  - Prevents event-loop overload during spike events
- Effort: ~1–2 days
- Files:
  - `order_executor.py`
  - `tick_handler.py`

---

## 🟦 7️⃣ Central Metrics / Observability

- Integrate with Prometheus / Grafana:
  - Tick evaluation speed
  - Order submission latency
  - Active trades count
- Benefits:
  - Production observability
  - Easier audits and monitoring
- Effort: ~2–3 days
- Files:
  - new metrics.py
  - updates in `tick_handler.py` and `trade_manager.py`

---

## 🟦 8️⃣ Heartbeat / Failover Process

- Add a watchdog heartbeat (if engine fails, supervisor restarts it)
- Log last tick timestamp per trade
- Alert if any trade stops receiving ticks for 10+ seconds
- Benefits:
  - Near-zero downtime
  - Safer for real money
- Effort: ~1–2 days
- Files:
  - new watchdog.py
  - minor hooks in `tick_handler.py`

---

# ✅ Recommendation

These features are not required **immediately**, but are common in institutional-grade execution stacks.  
They should be tracked and scheduled after dynamic contingent orders go live and the initial production release is stable.
