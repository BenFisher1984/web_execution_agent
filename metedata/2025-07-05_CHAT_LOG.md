## Session Summary

- Incorporated the parent/child OCO (contingent order) framework into the trade life cycle, clarifying that all orders (entry and contingent) are virtual until their trigger is met, and only then are they transmitted to the broker.
- Updated the trade and order status flows to reflect parent/child relationships, OCO logic, and the fully engine-managed approach.
- Added a comprehensive section to the life cycle document showing how trade status, parent order status, and child order status relate at each stage, including OCO group management and virtual vs. live order tracking.
- Began discussion on partial fills, agreeing to add a new trade status ("Partial Fill") and to extend the data model and status flows to handle partial fills for both parent and child orders.
- Clarified that all rule types (Entry, Initial Stop, Trailing Stop, Take Profit) are managed as single rules per trade, and that partial fill/OCO logic must apply to all, not just trailing stops.
- Addressed the distinction between rules and the orders they generate, ensuring the framework remains rule-agnostic and robust.
- Discussed session continuity and the meaning of the "Start a new chat for better results" UI message, confirming that context is preserved as long as summary documents and chat logs are attached at the start of a new session.

- Assistant confirmed understanding and readiness to proceed with a unified, rule-agnostic approach.

## Next Steps
