# ExecutionAgent Business Proposal

---

## Vision

ExecutionAgent aims to become the preeminent broker-agnostic, data-agnostic execution platform — delivering a structured, secure, and community-driven framework to manage and execute trades after the trader has made their market decision.

Where TradingView has transformed charting and research, ExecutionAgent will transform the “final mile” of trade execution and post-trade risk management.

Our long-term vision includes pursuing a partnership with TradingView to offer ExecutionAgent as a premium add-on within their subscription tiers, serving as the gold-standard execution and risk management engine.

## Summary

ExecutionAgent will serve as a robust, modular, and highly extensible execution and post-trade risk platform. It will:

- **Be broker agnostic** through a plug-in adapter model, similar to TradingView’s data-source separation
- **Be market data agnostic**, enabling users to connect their own data feeds (e.g., from a broker or dedicated market data vendor)
- **Clearly separate** execution adapters, market data adapters, and risk/rules engines for maximum modularity
- **Focus exclusively on post-decision execution** — no scanning, no alpha modeling, no signal generation
- **Provide advanced risk controls**, both at the portfolio level and the trade level
- **Offer a fully customizable dashboard/GUI** where traders can define their fields, visualizations, and workflows
- **Enable automated execution** from alerts (Pine Script or any third-party system) via secure, authenticated JSON payloads
- **Integrate with TradingView’s Pine Script alerts** if partnerships and licensing allow, while remaining independently viable
- **Support community-driven risk scripting**, similar to TradingView’s Pine Script marketplace
- **Allow user-created AI plug-ins** to be integrated, validated, and shared in an open, collaborative environment
- **Provide a standardized reverse adapter** so third-party models or alerts can trigger structured, validated trades
- **Support multiple execution modes**: manual, from a TradingView chart, from the trade grid, or via automated alerts
- **Deliver trade blotters, post-trade analytics, and risk frameworks** in an open, extensible architecture

ExecutionAgent’s sole mission is to be the *final mile* between the trader’s decision and the market, ensuring robust, validated, and secure execution.
