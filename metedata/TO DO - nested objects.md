Step 1: Extend and Formalize JSON Schema
Modify your existing trade_schema.json to define nested objects explicitly for complex fields (trailing_stop_rule, take_profit_rule, entry_rule, etc.).

Use "type": "object" and define properties, required, and enum for all nested fields.

Keep optional fields and sensible defaults for backward compatibility.

Step 2: Implement JSON Schema Validation
Integrate jsonschema validation in your backend APIs or import routines to validate incoming JSON against your updated schema.

Return clear, user-friendly validation errors on failure.

Step 3: Adapt Data Models and Evaluators
Refactor ingestion layers to accept nested dicts matching the schema, preserving full hierarchy.

Update evaluators to safely access nested fields—use helper functions for deep dictionary access to avoid key errors.

Optionally adopt Pydantic models to parse and validate nested data strongly within Python.

Step 4: Update Serialization and Persistence
Ensure your save/load logic (e.g., saved_trades.json) fully supports nested JSON structures without flattening or data loss.

Use consistent schema validation before save and after load.

Step 5: Enhance Frontend/Backend Integration
Sync frontend form structures with the updated schema, allowing nested input and validation.

Ensure frontend submits properly nested JSON.

Consider shared schema files or codegen to keep frontend/backend consistent.

Step 6: Testing and Validation
Write or expand tests for:

Schema validation correctness.

Evaluators handling nested trade data correctly.

Serialization/deserialization preserving nested structure.

Full end-to-end flows (frontend → backend → storage → evaluation).

Step 7: Documentation and Developer Tooling
Document the JSON schema and nested structures for your team.

Provide sample nested trade JSON files for onboarding and testing.

Possibly create utilities to generate or validate example nested trade data.
