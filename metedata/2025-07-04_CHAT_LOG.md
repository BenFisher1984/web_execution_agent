## Session Summary

- Discussed the overall architecture and design principles for a rule-driven trading execution platform targeting serious retail traders.
- Clarified the philosophy: backend-driven, strict validation, reliability first, extensibility, and user experience.
- Outlined the rule structure: one rule per type (Entry, Initial Stop, Trailing Stop, Take Profit) per trade.
- Discussed indicator handling, TradingView alert integration, portfolio filters, validation workflow, and logging/audit requirements.
- Created and saved `STRATEGY_RULE_ENGINE_DESIGN.md` and `DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md` to capture all key decisions.
- Reviewed a screenshot of the GUI prototype and mapped out the basic user workflow.
- Agreed to ignore the 7-rules-per-type UI for now and focus on one rule per type per trade.
- Walked through the basic user journey: trade setup, rule configuration, controls (Action, Strategy, Portfolio), and backend validation.
- Outlined the trade life cycle: Draft → Saved → Active/Pending → Filled/Open → Closed/Completed/Cancelled, with backend validation as the gatekeeper.
- Agreed to define the trade/order data model next, after confirming the life cycle.
